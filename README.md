# TicTacToe-Q-Learner-Interactive
In this project, we aim to showcase the progressive development of our Q-learning agent, harnessing the power of DQN, to transform it into a sophisticated strategist. The agent learns and adapts its tactics through an iterative learning process, providing a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of artificial intelligence

## Backend set-up 
* create virtual environment : `python -m venv env` 
* activate the virtual environement: `source ./env/Scripts/activate` (windows) or `. /env/bin/activate`(linux and macos)
* `pip install -r requirement.txt` (../BE/requirement)
* `python3 manager runserver` 

## Frontend set-up 
* `npm i`
* `ng serve`
